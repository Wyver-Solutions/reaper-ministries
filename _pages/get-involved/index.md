We rely entirely on donations from the UK for both the mission work and the Good Hope School project.

If you would like to support us please send a cheque (payable to Reaper Ministries International). If you would like to make a donation by bank transfer or set up a Standing Order please get in touch.

If you are a tax payer and would like your donations to be treated as Gift Aided donations please ask for a Gift Aid Declaration form.

Last, but not least, please pray for the work to which God has called Richard and the team. Thank you

The ministry costs include the expenses of holding meetings any publicity, and Richardâ€™s travel for overseas missions. Richard does not take a salary from the ministry funds, and all administration is done voluntarily. Other ministry team members do not take travel or accommodation costs from the ministry funds.

We would ask that you prayerfully consider giving to the work of Reaper Ministries and help us to give to those less fortunate than ourselves.
