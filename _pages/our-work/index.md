Reaper Ministries mainly works in Malawi, providing:

- Education and family support through Good Hope Primary School
- Support for Christian conferences and outreach

Richardâ€™s first visit with a team to Malawi in 2006 involved running a conference and outreach in Lilongwe, the capital, and in villages elsewhere in the nation.

This first outreach in Lilongwe resulted in 140 new converts and a new local church was formed.

Each year since, teams have gone for two to three weeks at a time, working with more than one church grouping.  Currently we have close links with the Presbyterian church in Malawi (Church of Central Africa Presbyterian).  Frank Kuseni who is a leading lay member in that church, as well as being a former Member of Parliament, is helping us with organising the missions and being an ambassador for the school.

These missions have involved running crusades and conferences, holding prison visits and ministering in local churches.  Much of the work has been in Lilongwe but some has been in outlying villages and also in Blantyre.

In 2008 Good Hope Free Primary School was founded as a Christian school for poor children in a township area on the edge of Lilongwe. This has grown and now has around 350 pupils.
